Hi, I’m @chetflowers.
I’m passionate about cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and ethical hacking, with a focus on mastering networking, system security, and penetration testing.

I’m currently focused on building a strong foundation in advanced network security, hands-on firewall configuration, and vulnerability assessments while showcasing projects on GitHub.

I’m eager to collaborate on security research, Red Team/Blue Team simulations, and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

Feel free to connect with me: LinkedIn - Chet Flowers

Fun fact: I competed in the world’s largest 9-ball tournament in Las Vegas and made it to day three!
